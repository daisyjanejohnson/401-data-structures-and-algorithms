# Binary Search Array

* Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Challenge
* Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
* I approached this by breaking the array into parts based on the average mid number from the min and max numbers in the array.
