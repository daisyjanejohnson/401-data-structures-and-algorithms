# Singly Linked List
Linked lists are data structures that contains nodes that link to the nodes that follow it in a list.

## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
* Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the Test Driven Development approach by first creating tests for what the assignment asked and adjusted my code until those requirements were met and the tests passed.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

## Chall 07 
### Kth to the End
* 

## Challenge
* Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Chall 08 
### Zip Lists
* Zip two Linked Lists

## Challenge
* Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Efficiencyt Time = On , as long as the shortest list. Space is O(1)
